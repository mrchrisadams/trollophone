Trollophone
=================================

This is me messing around with Twilio at a hackday - for fun, and partly to see if I can apply some 12factor concepts to a little app written in PHP.

My main aim is to learn how to make PHP example apps as portable as Ruby and Node apps are when working with PaaS services like heroku and so on.

This was just created for fun, please don't use it to be a dick.
